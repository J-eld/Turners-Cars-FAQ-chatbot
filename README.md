# Turners-Cars-FAQ-chatbot
This is a chatbot designed using IBM Watson that answers questions from the FAQ section of Turners Cars.

In this exercise, I had experience not only learning about using the IBM Cloud platform, but I learned a lot about the ethics that we must consider when using AI. As I was using Watson, I had to consider the implications of using a chatbot, and the ethical concerns a company needs to consider.

Additionally I learned:
 - Design guidelines to follow when creating a chatbot
 - Experience using the IBM Cloud Watson Assistant service
 - Implemented a chatbot that successfully recreated the “online auctions” section of Turners Cars FAQ [https://www.turners.co.nz/FAQs-Cars/]
